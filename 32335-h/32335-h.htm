<h3><a name="THE_OLD_SOLDIERS_STORY" id="THE_OLD_SOLDIERS_STORY"></a>THE OLD SOLDIER'S STORY<br />
<br />
<small>AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY</small></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> we have had no stories to-night I will venture, Mr. President,
to tell a story that I have heretofore heard at nearly all the
banquets I have ever attended. It is a story simply, and you must bear
with it kindly. It is a story as told by a friend of us all, who is
found in all parts of all countries, who is immoderately fond of a
funny story, and who, unfortunately, attempts to tell a funny story
himself&mdash;one that he has been particularly delighted with. Well, he is
not a story-teller, and especially he is not a funny story-teller. His
funny stories, indeed, are oftentimes touchingly pathetic. But to such
a story as he tells, being a good-natured man and kindly disposed, we
have to listen, because we do not want to wound his feelings by
telling him that we have heard that story a great number of times, and
that we have heard it ably told by a great number of people from the
time we were children. But, as I say, we can not hurt his feelings. We
can not stop him. We can not kill him; and so the story generally
proceeds. He selects a very old story always, and generally tells it
in about this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>I heerd an awful funny thing the other day&mdash;ha! ha! I don't know
whether I kin git it off er not, but, anyhow, I'll tell it to you.
Well!&mdash;le's see now how the fool-thing goes. Oh, yes!&mdash;W'y, there was
a feller one time&mdash;it was durin' the army, and this feller that I
started in to tell you about was in the war, and&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;there was a
big fight a-goin' on, and this feller was in the fight, and it was a
big battle and bullets a-flyin' ever' which way, and bombshells
a-bu'stin', and cannon-balls a-flyin' 'round promiskus; and this
feller right in the midst of it, you know, and all excited and het up,
and chargin' away; and the fust thing you know along come a
cannon-ball and shot his head off&mdash;ha! ha! ha! Hold on here a
minute!&mdash;no sir; I'm a-gittin' ahead of my story; no, no; it didn't
shoot his <i>head</i> off&mdash;I'm gittin' the cart before the horse there&mdash;shot
his <i>leg</i> off; that was the way; shot his leg off; and down the poor
feller drapped, and, of course, in that condition was perfectly
he'pless, you know, but yit with presence o' mind enough to know that
he was in a dangerous condition ef somepin' wasn't done fer him right
away. So he seen a comrade a-chargin' by that he knowed, and he
hollers to him and called him by name&mdash;I disremember now what the
feller's name was....</p>

<p>Well, that's got nothin' to do with the story, anyway; he hollers to
him, he did, and says, "Hello, there," he says to him; "here, I want
you to come here and give me a lift; I got my leg shot off, and I want
you to pack me back to the rear of the battle"&mdash;where the doctors
always is, you know, during a fight&mdash;and he says, "I want you to pack
me back there where I can get med-dy-cinal attention er I'm a dead
man, fer I got my leg shot off," he says, "and I want you to pack me
back there so's the surgeons kin take keer of me." Well&mdash;the feller,
as luck would have it, ricko-nized him and run to him and throwed down
his own musket, so's he could pick him up; and he stooped down and
picked him up and kindo' half-way shouldered him and half-way helt him
betwixt his arms like, and then he turned and started back with
him&mdash;ha! ha! ha! Now, mind, the fight was still a-goin' on&mdash;and right
at the hot of the fight, and the feller, all excited, you know, like
he was, and the soldier that had his leg shot off gittin' kindo fainty
like, and his head kindo' stuck back over the feller's shoulder that
was carryin' him. And he hadn't got more'n a couple o' rods with him
when another cannon-ball come along and tuk his head off, shore
enough!&mdash;and the curioust thing about it was&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;that the feller
was a-packin' him didn't know that he had been hit ag'in at all, and
back he went&mdash;still carryin' the deceased back&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;to where
the doctors could take keer of him&mdash;as he thought. Well, his cap'n
happened to see him, and he thought it was a ruther cur'ous
p'ceedin's&mdash;a soldier carryin' a dead body out o' the fight&mdash;don't you
see? And so he hollers at him, and he says to the soldier, the cap'n
did, he says, "Hullo, there; where you goin' with that thing?" the
cap'n said to the soldier who was a-carryin' away the feller that had
his leg shot off. Well, his head, too, by that time. So he says,
"Where you goin' with that thing?" the cap'n said to the soldier who
was a-carryin' away the feller that had his leg shot off. Well, the
soldier he stopped&mdash;kinder halted, you know, like a private soldier
will when his presidin' officer speaks to him&mdash;and he says to him,
"W'y," he says, "Cap, it's a comrade o' mine and the pore feller has
got his leg shot off, and I'm a-packin' him back to where the doctors
is; and there was nobody to he'p him, and the feller would 'a' died in
his tracks&mdash;er track ruther&mdash;if it hadn't a-been fer me, and I'm
a-packin' him back where the surgeons can take keer of him; where he
can get medical attendance&mdash;er his wife's a widder!" he says, "'cause
he's got his leg shot off!" Then <i>Cap'n</i> says, "You blame fool you, he's
got his <i>head</i> shot off." So then the feller slacked his grip on the
body and let it slide down to the ground, and looked at it a minute,
all puzzled, you know, and says, "W'y, he told me it was his leg!" Ha!
ha! ha!</p>

<span class="i0">What was it? "The section-hands, just in advance."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I spit on my hands, and I rolled up my pants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I clumb like an imp that the fiends had let loose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up out of the depths of that deadly caboose.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I cast loose my ulster&mdash;each ear-tab let fall&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stood up with the boys&mdash;leaned&mdash;patted each head<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> has always been an inclination, or desire, rather, on my part to
believe in the mystic&mdash;even as far back as stretches the gum-elastic
remembrance of my first "taffy-pullin'" given in honor of my fifth
birthday; and the ghost-stories, served by way of ghastly dessert, by
our hired girl. In fancy I again live over all the scenes of that
eventful night:&mdash;</p>

<p>The dingy kitchen, with its haunting odors of a thousand feasts and
wash-days; the old bench-legged stove, with its happy family of
skillets, stewpans and round-bellied kettles crooning and blubbering
about it. And how we children clustered round the genial hearth, with
the warm smiles dying from our faces just as the embers dimmed and
died out in the open grate, as with bated breath we listened to how
some one's grandmother had said that her first man went through a
graveyard once, one stormy night, "jest to show the neighbors that he
wasn't afeard o' nothin'," and how when he was just passing the grave
of his first wife "something kind o' big and white-like, with great
big eyes like fire, raised up from behind the headboard, and kind o'
re'ched out for him"; and how he turned and fled, "with that air white
thing after him as tight as it could jump, and a hollerin'
'wough-yough-yough!' till you could hear it furder'n you could a
bullgine," and how, at last, just as the brave and daring intruder was
clearing two graves and the fence at one despairing leap, the "white
thing," had made a grab at him with its iron claws, and had nicked him
so close his second wife was occasioned the onerous duty of affixing
another patch in his pantaloons. And in conclusion, our hired girl
went on to state that this blood-curdling incident had so wrought upon
the feelings of "the man that wasn't afeard o' nothin'," and had given
him such a distaste for that particular graveyard, that he never
visited it again, and even entered a clause in his will to the effect
that he would ever remain an unhappy corpse should his remains be
interred in said graveyard.</p>

<p>I forgot my pop-corn that night; I forgot my taffy; I forgot all
earthly things; and I tossed about so feverishly in my little bed, and
withal so restlessly, that more than once my father's admonition above
the footboard of the big bed, of "Drat you! go to sleep, there!"
foreshadowed my impending doom. And once he leaned over and made a
vicious snatch at me, and holding me out at arm's length by one leg,
demanded in thunder-tones, "what in the name o' flames and flashes I
meant, anyhow!"</p>

<p>I was afraid to stir a muscle from that on, in consequence of which I
at length straggled off in fitful dreams&mdash;and heavens! what dreams!&mdash;A
very long and lank, and slim and slender old woman in white knocked at
the door of my vision, and I let her in. She patted me on the
head&mdash;and oh! how cold her hands were! And they were very hard hands,
too, and very heavy&mdash;and, horror of horrors!&mdash;they were not
hands&mdash;they were claws!&mdash;they were iron!&mdash;they were like the things I
had seen the hardware man yank nails out of a keg with. I quailed and
shivered till the long and slim and slender old woman jerked my head
up and snarled spitefully, "What's the matter with you, bub," and I
said, "Nawthin'!" and she said, "Don't you dare to lie to me!" I
moaned.</p>

<p>"Don't you like me?" she asked.</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>"And lie if you dare!" she said&mdash;"Don't you like me?"</p>

<p>"Oomh-oomh!" said I.</p>

<p>"Why?" said she.</p>

<p>"Cos, you're too long&mdash;and slim&mdash;an'"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on!" said she.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And tall!" said I.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said she,&mdash;"and that's it, hey?"</p>

<p>And then she began to grow shorter and thicker, and fatter and
squattier.</p>

<p>"And how do I suit you now?" she wheezed at length, when she had
wilted down to about the size of a large loaf of bread.</p>

<p>I shook more violently than ever at the fearful spectacle.</p>

<p>"How do you like me now?" she yelped again,&mdash;"And don't you lie to me
neither, or I'll swaller you whole!"</p>

<p>I writhed and hid my face.</p>

<p>"Do you like me?"</p>

<p>"No-o-oh!" I moaned.</p>

<p>She made another snatch at my hair. I felt her jagged claws sink into
my very brain. I struggled and she laughed hideously.</p>

<p>"You don't, hey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I do. I love you!" said I.</p>

<p>"You lie! You lie!" She shrieked derisively. "You know you lie!" and
as I felt the iron talons sinking and gritting in my very brain, with
one wild, despairing effort, I awoke.</p>

<p>I saw the fire gleaming in the grate, and by the light it made I dimly
saw the outline of the old mantelpiece that straddled it, holding the
old clock high upon its shoulders. I was awake then, and the little
squatty woman with her iron talons was a dream! I felt an oily
gladness stealing over me, and yet I shuddered to be all alone.</p>

<p>If only some one were awake, I thought, whose blessed company would
drown all recollections of that fearful dream; but I dared not stir or
make a noise. I could only hear the ticking of the clock, and my
father's sullen snore. I tried to compose my thoughts to pleasant
themes, but that telescopic old woman in white would rise up and mock
my vain appeals, until in fancy I again saw her altitudinous
proportions dwindling into that repulsive and revengeful figure with
the iron claws, and I grew restless and attempted to sit up. Heavens!
something yet held me by the hair. The chill sweat that betokens
speedy dissolution gathered on my brow. I made another effort and
arose, that deadly clutch yet fastened in my hair. Could it be
possible! The short, white woman still held me in her vengeful grasp!
I could see her white dress showing from behind either of my ears. She
still clung to me, and with one wild, unearthly cry of "Pap!" I
started round the room.</p>

<p>I remember nothing further, until as the glowing morn sifted through
the maple at the window, powdering with gold the drear old room, and
baptizing with its radiance the anxious group of old home-faces
leaning over my bed, I heard my father's voice once more rasping on my
senses&mdash;"Now get the booby up, and wash that infernal wax out of his
hair!"</p>

<br />
<small>BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR</small></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a dim and chill and loveless afternoon in the late fall of
eighty-three when I first saw the genial subject of this hasty sketch.
From time to time the daily paper on which I worked had been
receiving, among the general literary driftage of amateur essayists,
poets and sketch-writers, some conceits in verse that struck the
editorial head as decidedly novel; and, as they were evidently the
production of an unlettered man, and an <i>old</i> man, and a farmer at that,
they were usually spared the waste-basket, and preserved&mdash;not for
publication, but to pass from hand to hand among the members of the
staff as simply quaint and mirth-provoking specimens of the verdancy
of both the venerable author and the Muse inspiring him. Letters as
quaint as were the poems invariably accompanied them, and the oddity
of these, in fact, had first called attention to the verses. I well
remember the general merriment of the office when the first of the old
man's letters was read aloud, and I recall, too, some of his comments
on his own verse, verbatim. In one place he said: "I make no doubt you
will find some purty <i>sad</i> spots in my poetry, considerin'; but I hope
you will bear in mind that I am a great sufferer with rheumatizum, and
have been, off and on, sence the cold New Year's. In the main,
however," he continued, "I allus aim to write in a cheerful,
comfortin' sperit, so's ef the stuff hangs fire, and don't do no good,
it hain't a-goin' to do no harm,&mdash;and them's my honest views on
poetry."</p>

<p>In another letter, evidently suspecting his poem had not appeared in
print because of its dejected tone, he said: "The poetry I herewith
send was wrote off on the finest Autumn day I ever laid eyes on! I
never felt better in my life. The morning air was as invigoratin' as
bitters with tanzy in it, and the folks at breakfast said they never
saw such a' appetite on mortal man before. Then I lit out for the
barn, and after feedin', I come back and tuck my pen and ink out on
the porch, and jest cut loose. I writ and writ till my fingers was
that cramped I couldn't hardly let go of the penholder. And the poem I
send you is the upshot of it all. Ef you don't find it cheerful enough
fer your columns, I'll have to knock under, that's all!" And that
poem, as I recall it, certainly was cheerful enough for publication,
only the "copy" was almost undecipherable, and the ink, too, so pale
and vague, it was thought best to reserve the verses, for the time, at
least, and later on revise, copy, punctuate, and then print it
sometime, as much for the joke of it as anything. But it was still
delayed, neglected, and in a week's time almost entirely forgotten.
And so it was, upon this chill and sombre afternoon I speak of that an
event occurred which most pleasantly reminded me of both the poem with
the "sad spots" in it, and the "cheerful" one, "writ out on the porch"
that glorious autumn day that poured its glory through the old man's
letter to us.</p>

<p>Outside and in the sanctum the gloom was too oppressive to permit an
elevated tendency of either thought or spirit. I could do nothing but
sit listless and inert. Paper and pencil were before me, but I could
not write&mdash;I could not even think coherently, and was on the point of
rising and rushing out into the streets for a wild walk, when there
came a hesitating knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" I snarled, grabbing up my pencil and assuming a frightfully
industrious air: "Come in!" I almost savagely repeated, "Come in! And
shut the door behind you!" and I dropped my lids, bent my gaze fixedly
upon the blank pages before me and began scrawling some disconnected
nothings with no head or tail or anything.</p>

<p>"Sir; howdy," said a low and pleasant voice. And at once, in spite of
my perverse resolve, I looked up. I someway felt rebuked.</p>

<p>The speaker was very slowly, noiselessly closing the door. I could
hardly face him when he turned around. An old man, of sixty-five, at
least, but with a face and an eye of the most cheery and wholesome
expression I had ever seen in either youth or age. Over his broad
bronzed forehead and white hair he wore a low-crowned, wide-brimmed
black felt hat, somewhat rusted now, and with the band grease-crusted,
and the binding frayed at intervals, and sagging from the threads that
held it on. An old-styled frock coat of black, dull brown in streaks,
and quite shiny about the collar and lapels. A waistcoat of no
describable material or pattern, and a clean white shirt and collar of
one piece, with a black string-tie and double bow, which would have
been entirely concealed beneath the long white beard but for its
having worked around to one side of the neck. The front outline of the
face was cleanly shaven, and the beard, growing simply from the under
chin and throat, lent the old pioneer the rather singular appearance
of having hair all over him with this luxurious growth pulled out
above his collar for mere sample.</p>

<p>I arose and asked the old man to sit down, handing him a chair
decorously.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," he said&mdash;"I'm much obleeged. I hain't come in to bother you
no more'n I can he'p. All I wanted was to know ef you got my poetry
all right. You know I take yer paper," he went on, in an explanatory
way, "and seein' you printed poetry in it once-in-a-while, I sent you
some of mine&mdash;neighbors kindo' advised me to," he added
apologetically, "and so I sent you some&mdash;two or three times I sent you
some, but I hain't never seed hide-ner-hair of it in your paper, and
as I wus in town to-day, anyhow, I jest thought I'd kindo' drap in and
git it back, ef you ain't goin' to print it&mdash;'cause I allus save up
most the things I write, aimin' sometime to git 'em all struck off in
pamphlet-form, to kindo' distribit round 'mongst the neighbors, don't
you know."</p>

<p>Already I had begun to suspect my visitor's identity, and was
mechanically opening the drawer of our poetical department.</p>

<p>"How was your poetry signed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Signed by my own name," he answered proudly,&mdash;"signed by my own
name,&mdash;Johnson&mdash;Benjamin F. Johnson, of Boone County&mdash;this state."</p>

<p>"And is this one of them, Mr. Johnson?" I asked, unfolding a
clumsily-folded manuscript, and closely scrutinizing the verse.</p>

<p>"How does she read?" said the old man eagerly, and searching in the
meantime for his spectacles. "How does she read?&mdash;Then I can tell
you!"</p>

<p>"It reads," said I, studiously conning the old man's bold but bad
chirography, and tilting my chair back indolently,&mdash;"it reads like
this&mdash;the first verse does,"&mdash;and I very gravely read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Oh! the old swimmin'-hole!"</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" said the old man excitedly&mdash;"Stop right there! That's my
poetry, but that's not the way to read it by a long shot! Give it to
me!" and he almost snatched it from my hand. "Poetry like this ain't
no poetry at all, 'less you read it <i>natchurl</i> and <i>in jes the same
sperit 'at it's writ in</i>, don't you understand. It's a' old man
a-talkin', rickollect, and a-feelin' kindo' sad, and yit kindo' sorto'
good, too, and I opine he wouldn't got that off with a face on him
like a' undertaker, and a voice as solemn as a cow-bell after dark!
He'd say it more like this."&mdash;And the old man adjusted his spectacles
and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>My applause was long and loud. The old man's interpretation of the
poem was a positive revelation, though I was glad enough to conceal
from him my moistened eyes by looking through the scraps for other
specimens of his verse.</p>

<p>"Here," said I enthusiastically, "is another one, signed 'Benj. F.
Johnson,' read me this," and I handed him the poem.</p>

<p>The old man smiled and took the manuscript. "This-here one's on '<i>The
Hoss</i>,'" he said, simply clearing his throat. "They ain't so much
fancy-work about this as the other'n, but they's jest as much <i>fact</i>,

<p>Again I applauded, handing the old man still another of his poems, and
the last received. "Ah!" said he, as his gentle eyes bent on the
title; "this-here's the cheerfullest one of 'em all. This is the one
writ, as I wrote you about&mdash;on that glorious October morning two weeks
ago&mdash;I thought your paper would print this-un, shore!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it <i>will</i> print it," I said eagerly; "and it will print the other
two as well! It will print <i>anything</i> that you may do us the honor to
offer, and we'll reward you beside just as you may see fit to
designate.&mdash;But go on&mdash;go on! Read me the poem."</p>

entitled</p>

<p>That was enough! "Surely," thought I, "here is a diamond in the rough,
and a 'gem,' too, 'of purest ray serene'!" I caught the old man's hand
and wrung it with positive rapture; and it is needless to go further
in explanation of how the readers of our daily came to an acquaintance
through its columns with the crude, unpolished, yet most gentle genius
of Benj. F. Johnson, of Boone.

<h3><a name="THE_JUDKINS_PAPERS" id="THE_JUDKINS_PAPERS"></a>THE JUDKINS PAPERS</h3>

<p class="center"><b>FATHER AND SON</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Judkins'</span> boy came home yesterday with a bottle of bugs in his
pocket, and as the quiet little fellow sat on the back porch in his
favorite position, his legs elbowed and flattened out beneath him like
a letter "W," his genial and eccentric father came suddenly upon him.</p>

<p>"And what's the blame' boy up to now?" said Mr. Judkins, in an assumed
tone of querulous displeasure, as he bent over the boy from behind and
gently tweaked his ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, here, mister!" said the boy, without looking up; "you thist let
up on that, will you!"</p>

<p>"What you got there, I tell you!" continued the smiling Mr. Judkins,
in a still gruffer tone, relinquishing the boy's ear, and gazing down
upon the fluffy towhead with more than ordinary admiration. "What you
got there?"</p>

<p>"Bugs," said the boy&mdash;"you know!"</p>

<p>"Dead, are they?" said Mr. Judkins.</p>

<p>"Some of 'em's dead," said the boy, carefully running a needle through
the back of a large bumblebee. "All these uns is, you kin bet! You
don't think a feller 'ud try to string a live bumblebee, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, 'Squire," said Mr. Judkins, airily, addressing the boy by
one of the dozen nicknames he had given him; "not a live bumblebee&mdash;a
real stem-winder, of course not. But what in the name o' limpin'
Lazarus air you stringin' 'em fer?"</p>

<p>"Got a live snake-feeder," said the boy, ignoring the parental
inquiry. "See him down there in the bottom, 'ith all th' other uns on
top of him. Thist watch him now, an' you kin see him pant. I kin. Yes,
an' I got a beetle 'at's purt' nigh alive, too&mdash;on'y he can't pull in
his other wings. See 'em?" continued the boy, with growing enthusiasm,
twirling the big-mouthed bottle like a kaleidoscope. "Hate beetles!
'cause they allus act so big, an' make s'much fuss about theirselves,
an' don't know nothin' neither! Bet ef I had as many wings as a beetle
I wouldn't let no boy my size knock the stuffin' out o' me with no
bunch o' weeds, like I done him!"</p>

<p>"Howd'ye know you wouldn't?" said Mr. Judkins, austerely, biting his
nails and winking archly to himself.</p>

<p>"W'y, I know I wouldn't," said the boy, "'cause I'd keep up in the air
where I could fly, an' wouldn't come low down ut all&mdash;bumpin' around
'mongst them bushes, an' buzzin' against things, an' buttin' my brains
out a-tryin' to git thue fence cracks."</p>

<p>"'Spect you'd ruther be a snake-feeder, wouldn't you, Bud?" said Mr.
Judkins suggestively. "Snake-feeders has got about enough wings to
suit you, ef you want more'n one pair, and ever' day's a picnic with a
snake-feeder, you know. Nothin' to do but jes' loaf up and down the
crick, and roost on reeds and cat-tails, er fool around a feller's
fish-line and light on the cork and bob up and down with it till she
goes clean under, don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Don't want to be no snake-feeder, neither," said the boy, "'cause
they gits gobbled up, first thing they know, by these 'ere big green
bullfrogs ut they can't ever tell from the skum till they've lit right
in their mouth&mdash;and then they're goners! No, sir;" continued the boy,
drawing an extra quinine-bottle from another pocket, and holding it up
admiringly before his father's eyes: "There's the feller in there ut
I'd ruther be than have a pony!"</p>

<p>"W'y, it's a nasty p'izen spider!" exclaimed Mr. Judkins, pushing back
the bottle with affected abhorrence, "and he's alive, too!"</p>

<p>"You bet he's alive!" said the boy, "an' you kin bet he'll never come
to no harm while I own him!" and as the little fellow spoke his face
glowed with positive affection, and the twinkle of his eyes, as he
continued, seemed wonderfully like his father's own. "Tell you, I like
spiders! Spiders is awful fat&mdash;all but their head&mdash;and that's level,
you kin bet! Flies hain't got no business with a spider. Ef a spider
ever reaches fer a fly, he's his meat! The spider, he likes to loaf
an' lay around in the shade an' wait fer flies an' bugs an' things to
come a-foolin' round his place. He lays back in the hole in the corner
of his web, an' waits till somepin' lights on it an' nen when he hears
'em buzzin', he thist crawls out an' fixes 'em so's they can't buzz,
an' he's got the truck to do it with! I bet ef you'd unwind all the
web-stuff out of thist one little spider not bigger'n a pill, it 'ud
be long enough fer a kite-string! Onc't they wuz one in our
wood-house, an' a taterbug got stuck in his web, an' the spider worked
purt' nigh two days 'fore he got him so's he couldn't move. Nen he
couldn't eat him neither&mdash;'cause they's shells on 'em, you know, an'
the spider didn't know how to hull him. Ever' time I'd go there the
spider, he'd be a-wrappin' more stuff around th' ole bug, an' stoopin'
down like he wuz a-whisperin' to him. An' one day I went in ag'in, an'
he was a-hangin', alas an' cold in death! An' I poked him with a
splinter an' his web broke off&mdash;'spect he'd used it all up on the
wicked bug&mdash;an' it killed him; an' I buried him in a' ink-bottle an'
mashed the old bug 'ith a chip!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Judkins, in a horrified tone, turning away to conceal the
real zest and enjoyment his face must have betrayed; "yes, and some
day you'll come home p'izened, er somepin'! And I want to say right
here, my young man, ef ever you do, and it don't kill you, I'll lint
you within an inch of your life!" And as the eccentric Mr. Judkins
whirled around the corner of the porch he heard the boy murmur in his
low, absent-minded way, "Yes, you will!"</p>


<p class="center"><b>MR. JUDKINS' REMARKS</b></p>

<p>Judkins stopped us in front of the post-office yesterday to say that
that boy of his was "the blamedest boy outside o' the annals o'
history!" "Talk about this boy-naturalist out here at Indianapolis,"
says Judkins,&mdash;"w'y, he ain't nowhere to my boy! The little cuss don't
do nothin' either only set around and look sleepy, and dern him, he
gits off more dry things than you could print in your paper. Of late
he's been a-displayin' a sort o' weakness fer Nature, don't you know;
and he's allus got a bottle o' bugs in his pocket. He come home
yesterday evening with a blame' mud-turtle as big as an unabridged
dictionary, and turned him over in the back yard and commenced biffin'
away at him with a hammer and a cold-chisel. 'W'y, you're a-killin'
the turtle,' says I. 'Kill nothin'!' says he, 'I'm thist a-takin' the
lid off so's I can see his clock works.' Hoomh!" says Judkins: "He's a
good one!&mdash;only," he added, "I wouldn't have the <i>boy</i> think so fer the
world!"</p>


<p class="center"><b>JUDKINS' BOY ON THE MUD-TURTLE</b></p>

<p>The mud-turtle is not a beast of pray, but he dearly loves catfish
bait. If a mud-turtle gits your big toe in his mouth he will hang on
till it thunders. Then he will spit it out like he was disgusted. The
mud-turtle kin swim and keep his chin out of water ef he wants to but
he don't care ef he does sink. The turtle kin stay under water until
his next birthday, an' never crack a smile. He kin breathe like a
grown person, but he don't haf to, on'y when he is on dry land, an'
then I guess he thist does it to be soshibul. Allus when you see
bubbles a-comin' up in the swimmin' hole, you kin bet your galluses
they's a mud-turtle a-layin' down there, studyin' up some cheap way to
git his dinner. Mud-turtles never dies, on'y when they make soup out
of 'em. They is seven kinds of meat in the turtle, but I'd ruther eat
thist plain burnt liver.</p>


<p class="center"><b>ON FROGS</b></p>

<p>Frogs is the people's friend, but they can't fly. Onc't they wuz
tadpoles about as big as lickerish drops, an' after while legs growed
on 'em. Oh, let us love the frog&mdash;he looks so sorry. Frogs kin swim
better'n little boys, and they don't haf to hold their nose when they
dive, neither. Onc't I had a pet frog; an' the cars run over him. It
thist squshed him. Bet he never knowed what hurt him! Onc't they wuz a
rich lady swallered one&mdash;when he wuz little, you know; an' he growed
up in her, an' it didn't kill him ut all. An' you could hear him
holler in her bosom. It was a tree-toad; and so ever' time he'd go
p-r-r-r-r- w'y, nen the grand lady she'd know it was goin' to rain,
an' make her little boy run an' putt the tub under the spout. Wasn't
that a b'utiful frog?</p>


<p class="center"><b>ON PIRUTS</b></p>

<p>Piruts is reckless to a fault. They ain't afeard of nobody ner
nothin'. Ef ever you insult a pirut onc't, he'll foller you to the
grave but what he will revenge his wrongs. Piruts all looks like
pictures of "Buffalo Bill"&mdash;on'y they don't shave off the whiskers
that sticks out over the collar of their low-necked shirt. Ever' day
is a picknick fer the piruts of the high seas. They eat gunpowder an'
drink blood to make 'em savage, and then they kill people all day, an'
set up all night an' tell ghost stories an' sing songs such as mortal
ear would quail to listen to. Piruts never comes on shore on'y when
they run out of tobacker; an' then it's a cold day ef they don't land
at midnight, an' disguize theirselves an' slip up in town like a
sleuth houn', so's the Grand Jury can't git on to 'em. They don't care
fer the police any more than us people who dwells right in their
midst. Piruts makes big wages an' spends it like a king. "Come easy,
go easy," is the fatal watchword of them whose deeds is Deth. Onc't
they wuz a pirut turned out of the house an' home by his cruel parents
when he wuz but a kid, an' so he always went by that name. He was
thrust adrift without a nickel, an' sailed fer distant shores to hide
his shame fer those he loved. In the dead of night he stol'd a new
suit of the captain's clothes. An' when he growed up big enough to fit
'em, he gaily dressed hissef and went up an' paced the quarter-deck in
deep thought. He had not fergot how the captain onc't had lashed him
to the jib-boom-poop an' whipped him. That stung his proud spirit even
then; an' so the first thing he done was to slip up behind the cruel
officer an' push him over-board. Then the ship wuz his fer better er
fer worse. An' so he took command, an' hung high upon the beetling
mast the pirut flag. Then he took the Bible his old mother give him,
an' tied a darnic round it an' sunk it in the sand with a mocking
laugh. Then it wuz that he wuz ready fer the pirut's wild seafaring
life. He worked the business fer all they wuz in it fer many years,
but wuz run in ut last. An', standin' on the gallus-tree, he sung a
song which wuz all wrote off by hissef. An' then they knocked the trap
on him. An' thus the brave man died and never made a kick. In life he
wuz allus careful with his means, an' saved up vast welth, which he
dug holes and buried, an' died with the secret locked in his bosom to
this day.</p>


<p class="center"><b>ON HACKMENS</b></p>

<p>Hackmens has the softest thing in the bizness. They hain't got nothin'
to do but look hump-shouldered an' chaw tobacker an' wait. Hackmens
all looks like detectives, an' keeps still, an' never even spits when
you walk past 'em. An' they're allus cold. A hackman that stands high
in the p'fession kin wear a overcoat in dog-days an' then look chilly
an' like his folks wuz all dead but the old man, an' he wuz a
drunkard. Ef a hackman would on'y be a blind fiddler he'd take in more
money than a fair-ground. Hackmens never gives nothin' away. You kin
trust a hackman when you can't trust your own mother. Some people
thinks when they hire a hack to take 'em some place that the hackman
has got some grudge ag'in' 'em&mdash;but he hain't&mdash;he's allus that way. He
loves you but he knows his place, and smothers his real feelings. In
life's giddy scenes hackmens all wears a mask; but down deep in their
heart you kin bet they are yourn till deth. Some hackmens look like
they wuz stuck up, but they hain't&mdash;it's only 'cause they got on so
much clothes. Onc't a hackman wuz stabbed by a friend of his in the
same bizness, an' when the doctors wuz seein' how bad he wuz karved
up, they found he had on five shurts. They said that wuz all that
saved his life. They said ef he'd on'y had on four shurts, he'd 'a'
been a ded man. An' the hackman hissef, when he got well, used to brag
it wuz the closetest call he ever had, an' laid fer the other hackman,
an' hit him with a car couplin' an' killed him, an' come mighty nigh
goin' to the penitenchary fer it. Influenshal friends wuz all that
saved him that time. No five shurts would 'a' done it. The mayor said
that when he let him off, an' brought down the house, an' made hissef
a strong man fer another term. Some mayors is purty slick, but a
humble hackman may sometimes turn out to be thist as smooth. The on'y
thing w'y a hackman don't show up no better is 'cause he loses so much
sleep. That's why he allus looks like he had the headache, an' didn't
care ef he did. Onc't a hackman wuz waitin' in front of a hotel one
morning an' wuz sort o' dozin' like, an' fell off his seat. An' they
run an' picked him up, an' he wuz unconshus, an' they worked with him
till 'way long in the afternoon 'fore they found out he wuz thist
asleep; an' he cussed fearful cause they waked him up, an' wondered
why people couldn't never tend to their own bizness like he did.</p>


<p class="center"><b>ON DUDES</b></p>

<p>Ever'body is allus a-givin' it to Dudes. Newspapers makes fun of 'em,
an' artists makes pictures of 'em; an' the on'y ones in the wide world
that stuck on Dudes is me an' the Dudes theirse'f, an' we love an'
cherish 'em with all a parent's fond regards. An' nobody knows much
about Dudes neither, 'cause they hain't been broke out long enough yit
to tell thist what the disease is. Some say it's softinning of the
brains, an' others claim it can't be that, on the groun's they hain't
got material fer the softinning to work on, &amp;c., &amp;c., till even
"Sientests is puzzled," as the good book says. An' ef I wuz a-goin' to
say what ails Dudes I'd have to give it up, er pernounce it a'
aggervated case of Tyfoid blues, which is my 'onnest convictions.
That's what makes me kind o' stand in with 'em&mdash;same as ef they wuz
the under-dog. I am willing to aknolege that Dudes has their weakness,
but so has ever'thing. Even Oscar Wild, ef putt to the test; an' I
allus feel sorry fer George Washington 'cause he died 'fore he got to
see Oscar Wild. An' then another reason w'y you oughten't to jump on
to Dudes is, they don't know what's the matter with 'em any more than
us folks in whom they come in daily contack. Dudes all walks an' looks
in the face like they wuz on their way to fill an engagement with a
revolvin' lady wax-figger in some milliner-winder, an' had fergot the
number of her place of bizness. Some folks is mean enough to bitterly
a'sert that Dudes is strained in their manner an' fools from choice;
but they ain't. It's a gift&mdash;Dudes is Geenuses&mdash;that's what Dudes is!</p>


<p class="center"><b>ON RED HAIR</b></p>

<p>Onc't a pore boy wuz red-hedded, an' got mad at the other boys when
they'd throw it up to him. An' when they'd laugh at his red hed, an'
ast him fer a light, er wuzn't he afeard he'd singe his cap, an' orto'
wear a tin hat, er pertend to warm their hands by him,&mdash;w'y, sometimes
the red-hedded boy'd git purty hot indeed; an' onc't he told another
boy that wuz a-bafflin' him about his red hair that ef he wuz him he'd
git a fine comb an' go to canvassin' his own hed, and then he'd be
liabul to sceer up a more livelier subjeck to talk about than red
hair. An' then the other boy says, "You're a liar" an' that got the
red-hedded boy into more trouble; fer the old man whipped him
shameful' fer breakin' up soil with the other boy. An' this here
red-hedded boy had freckles, too. An' warts. An' nobody ortn't to 'a'
jumpt on to him fer that. Ef anybody wuz a red-hedded boy they'd have
also warts an' freckles&mdash;an' thist red-hair's bad enough. Onc't
another boy told him ef he wuz him he bet he could make a big day look
sick some night. An' when the red-hedded boy says "How?" w'y, the
other boy he says "Easy enough. I'd thist march around bare-hedded in
the torch-light p'cession."&mdash;"Yes, you would," says the red-hedded
boy, an' pasted him one with a shinny club, an' got dispelled from
school 'cause he wuz so high-tempered an' impulsiv. Ef I wuz the
red-hedded boy I'd be a pirut; but he allus said he wuz goin' to be a
baker.</p>


<p class="center"><b>THE CROSS-EYED GIRL</b></p>

<p>"You don't want to never tamper with a cross-eyed girl," said Mr.
Judkins, "and I'll tell you w'y: They've natur'lly got a better focus
on things than a man would ever guess&mdash;studyin' their eyes, you
understand. A man may think he's a-foolin' a cross-eyed girl simply
because she's apparently got her eyes tangled on other topics as he's
a-talkin' to her, but at the same time that girl may be a-lookin' down
the windin' stairway of the cellar of his soul with one eye, and
a-winkin' in a whisper to her own soul with the other, and her
unconscious victim jes' a-takin' it fer granted that nothin' is the
matter with the girl, only jes' cross-eyes! You see I've studied 'em,"
continued Judkins, "and I'm on to one fact dead sure&mdash;and that is,
their natures is as deceivin' as their eyes is! Knowed one onc't that
had her eyes mixed up thataway&mdash;sensitive little thing she was, and
always referrin' to her 'misfortune,' as she called it, and eternally
threatenin' to have some surgeon straighten 'em out like other
folks'&mdash;and, sir, that girl so worked on my feelin's, and took such
underholts on my sympathies that, blame me, before I knowed it I
confessed to her that ef it hadn't 'a' been fer her defective eyes (I
made it 'defective') I never would have thought of lovin' her, and,
furthermore ef ever she did have 'em changed back normal, don't you
understand, she might consider our engagement at an end&mdash;I did,
honest. And that girl was so absolute cross-eyed it warped her ears,
and she used to amuse herself by watchin' 'em curl up as I'd be
a-talkin' to her, and that maddened me, 'cause I'm natur'lly of a
jealous disposition, you know, and so, at last, I jes' casually hinted
that ef she was really a-goin' to git them eyes carpentered up, w'y
she'd better git at it: and that ended it.</p>

<p>"And then the blame' girl turned right around and married a fellow
that had a better pair of eyes than mine this minute! Then I struck
another cross-eyed girl&mdash;not really a legitimate case, 'cause, in
reality, she only had one off eye&mdash;the right eye, ef I don't
disremember&mdash;the other one was as square as a gouge. And that girl
was, ef any difference, a more confusin' case than the other, and
besides all that, she had some money in her own right, and warn't
a-throwin' off no big discount on one game eye. But I finally got her
interested, and I reckon something serious might 'a' come of it&mdash;but,
you see, her father was dead, and her stepmother sort o' shet down on
my comin' to the house; besides that, she had three grown uncles, and
you know how uncles is. I didn't want to marry no family, of course,
and so I slid out of the scheme, and tackled a poor girl that clerked
in a post-office. Her eyes was bad! I never did git the hang of them
eyes of hern. She had purty hair, and a complexion, I used to tell
her, which outrivalled the rose. But them eyes, you know! I didn't
really appreciate how bad they was crossed, at first. You see, it took
time. Got her to give me her picture, and I used to cipher on that,
but finally worked her off on a young friend of mine who wanted to
marry intellect&mdash;give her a good send-off to him&mdash;and she was
smart&mdash;only them eyes, you know! Why, that girl could read a postal
card, both sides at once, and smile at a personal friend through the
office window at the same time!"</p>


<p class="center"><b>HOMESICKNESS</b></p>

<p>There was a more than ordinary earnestness in the tone of Mr. Judkins
as he said: "Referrin' to this thing of bein' homesick, I want to
say right here that of all diseases, afflictions er complaints, this
thing of bein' homesick takes the cookies! A man may think when he's
got a' aggrivated case of janders, er white-swellin', say, er
bone-erysipelas, that he's to be looked up to as bein' purty well
fixed in this vale of trouble and unrest, but I want to tell you, when
I want my sorrow blood-raw, don't you understand, you may give me
homesickness&mdash;straight goods, you know&mdash;and I'll git more clean,
legitimate agony out of that than you can out of either of the other
attractions&mdash;yes, er even ef you'd ring in the full combination on me!
You see, there's no way of treatin' homesickness only one&mdash;and that is
to git back home&mdash;but as that's a remedy you can't git at no drug
store, at so much per box&mdash;and ef you could, fer instance, and only
had enough ready money anyhow to cover half the cost of a full
box&mdash;and nothin' but a full box ever reached the case&mdash;w'y, it follers
that your condition still remains critical. And homesickness don't
show no favors. It's jes' as liable to strike you as me. High er low,
er rich er poor, all comes under her jurishdiction, and whenever she
once reaches fer a citizen, you can jes' bet she gits there Eli, ever'
time!</p>

<p>"She don't confine herse'f to youth, ner make no specialty of little
children either, but she stalks abroad like a census-taker, and is as
conscientious. She visits the city girl clean up to Maxinkuckee, and
makes her wonder how things really is back home without her. And then
she haunts her dreams, and wakes her up at all hours of the night, and
sings old songs over fer her, and talks to her in low thrillin' tones
of a young man whose salary ain't near big enough fer two; and then
she leaves her photograph with her and comes away, and makes it lively
fer the boys on the train, the conductor, the brakeman and the
engineer. She even nests out the travellin' man, and yanks him out of
his reclinin' chair, and walks him up and down the car, and runs him
clean out of cigars and finecut, and smiles to hear him swear. Then
she gits off at little country stations and touches up the night
operator, who grumbles at his boy companion, and wishes to dernation
'six' was in, so's he could 'pound his ear.'</p>

<p>"And I'll never forgit," continued Mr. Judkins, "the last case of
homesickness I had, and the cure I took fer it. 'Tain't been more'n a
week ago neither. You see my old home is a'most too many laps from
this base to make it very often, and in consequence I hadn't been
there fer five years and better, till this last trip, when I jes'
succumbed to the pressure, and th'owed up my hands and went. Seemed
like I'd 'a' died if I hadn't. And it was glorious to rack around the
old town again&mdash;things lookin' jes' the same, mighty nigh, as they was
when I was a boy, don't you know. Run acrost an old schoolmate, too,
and tuck supper at his happy little home, and then we got us a good
nickel cigar, and walked and walked, and talked and talked! Tuck me
all around, you understand, in the meller twilight&mdash;till, the first
thing you know, there stood the old schoolhouse where me and him first
learnt to chew tobacco, and all that! Well, sir! you hain't got no
idea of the feelin's that was mine! W'y, I felt like I could th'ow my
arms around the dear old buildin' and squeeze it till the cupolo would
jes' pop out of the top of the roof like the core out of a b'ile! And
I think if they ever was a' epoch in my life when I could 'a' tackled
poetry without no compunctions, as the feller says, w'y, then was the
time&mdash;shore!"</p>

<h3><a name="THE_OBJECT_LESSON" id="THE_OBJECT_LESSON"></a>THE OBJECT LESSON</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Barely</span> a year ago I attended the Friday afternoon exercises of a
country school. My mission there, as I remember, was to refresh my
mind with such material as might be gathered, for a "valedictory,"
which, I regret to say, was to be handed down to posterity under
another signature than my own.</p>

<p>There was present, among a host of visitors, a pale young man of
perhaps thirty years, with a tall head and bulging brow and a highly
intellectual pair of eyes and spectacles. He wore his hair without
roach or "part" and the smile he beamed about him was "a joy forever."
He was an educator&mdash;from the East, I think I heard it rumoured&mdash;anyway
he was introduced to the school at last, and he bowed, and smiled, and
beamed upon us all, and entertained us after the most delightfully
edifying manner imaginable. And although I may fail to reproduce the
exact substance of his remarks upon that highly important occasion, I
think I can at least present his theme in all its coherency of detail.
Addressing more particularly the primary department of the school, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As the little exercise I am about to introduce is of recent origin,
and the bright, intelligent faces of the pupils before me seem rife
with eager and expectant interest, it will be well for me, perhaps, to
offer by way of preparatory preface, a few terse words of explanation.</p>

<p>"The Object Lesson is designed to fill a long-felt want, and is
destined, as I think, to revolutionize, in a great degree, the
educational systems of our land.&mdash;In my belief, the Object Lesson will
supply a want which I may safely say has heretofore left the most
egregious and palpable traces of mental confusion and intellectual
inadequacies stamped, as it were, upon the gleaming reasons of the
most learned&mdash;the highest cultured, and the most eminently gifted and
promising of our professors and scientists both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>"Now this deficiency&mdash;if it may be so termed&mdash;plainly has a beginning;
and probing deeply with the bright, clean scalpel of experience we
discover that&mdash;'As the twig is bent the tree's inclined.' To remedy,
then, a deeply seated error which for so long has rankled at the very
root of educational progress throughout the land, many plausible, and
we must admit, many helpful theories have been introduced to allay the
painful errors resulting from the discrepancy of which we speak: but
until now, nothing that seemed wholly to eradicate the defect has been
discovered, and that, too, strange as it may seem, is, at last,
emanating, like the mighty river, from the simplest source, but
broadening and gathering in force and power as it flows along, until,
at last, its grand and mighty current sweeps on in majesty to the vast
illimitable ocean of&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;Success! Ahem!</p>

<p>"And, now, little boys and girls, that we have had by implication, a
clear and comprehensive explanation of the Object Lesson and its
mission, I trust you will give me your undivided attention while I
endeavor&mdash;in my humble way&mdash;to direct your newly acquired knowledge
through the proper channel. For instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This little object I hold in my hand&mdash;who will designate it by its
proper name? Come, now, let us see who will be the first to answer. 'A
peanut,' says the little boy here at my right. Very good&mdash;very good! I
hold, then, in my hand, a peanut. And now who will tell me, what is
the peanut? A very simple question&mdash;who will answer? 'Something good
to eat,' says the little girl. Yes, 'something good to eat,' but would
it not be better to say simply that the peanut is an edible? I think
so, yes. The peanut, then, is&mdash;an edible&mdash;now, all together, an
edible!</p>

<p>"To what kingdom does the peanut belong? The animal, vegetable, or
mineral kingdom? A very easy question. Come, let us have prompt
answers. 'The animal kingdom,' does the little boy say? Oh, no! The
peanut does not belong to the animal kingdom! Surely the little boy
must be thinking of a larger object than the peanut&mdash;the elephant,
perhaps. To what kingdom, then, does the peanut belong? The
v-v-veg&mdash;'The vegetable kingdom,' says the bright-faced little girl on
the back seat. Ah! that is better. We find then that the peanut
belongs to the&mdash;what kingdom? The 'vegetable kingdom.' Very good, very
good!</p>

<p>"And now who will tell us of what the peanut is composed. Let us have
quick responses now. Time is fleeting! Of what is the peanut composed?
'The hull and the goody,' some one answers. Yes, 'the hull and the
goody' in vulgar parlance, but how much better it would be to say
simply, the shell and the kernel. Would not that sound better? Yes, I
thought you would agree with me there!</p>

<p>"And now who will tell me the color of the peanut! And be careful now!
for I shouldn't like to hear you make the very stupid blunder I once
heard a little boy make in reply to the same question. Would you like
to hear what color the stupid little boy said the peanut was? You
would, eh? Well, now, how many of you would like to hear what color
the stupid little boy said the peanut was? Come now, let's have an
expression. All who would like to hear what color the stupid little
boy said the peanut was, may hold up their right hands. Very good,
very good&mdash;there, that will do.</p>

<p>"Well, it was during a professional visit I was once called upon to
make to a neighboring city, where I was invited to address the
children of a free school&mdash;Hands down, now, little boy&mdash;founded for
the exclusive benefit of the little newsboys and bootblacks, who, it
seems, had not the means to defray the expenses of the commonest
educational accessories, and during an object lessen&mdash;identical with
the one before us now&mdash;for it is a favorite one of mine&mdash;I propounded
the question, what is the color of the peanut? Many answers were given
in response, but none as sufficiently succinct and apropos as I deemed
the facts demanded; and so at last I personally addressed a ragged,
but, as I then thought, a bright-eyed little fellow, when judge of my
surprise, in reply to my question what is the color of the peanut, the
little fellow, without the slightest gleam of intelligence lighting up
his face, answered, that 'if not scorched in roasting, the peanut was
a blond.' Why, I was almost tempted to join in the general merriment
his inapposite reply elicited. But I occupy your attention with
trivial things; and as I notice the time allotted to me has slipped
away, we will drop the peanut for the present. Trusting the few facts
gleaned from a topic so homely and unpromising will sink deep in your
minds, in time to bloom and blossom in the fields of future
usefulness&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;I thank you."</p>
